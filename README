Scripts
-------

A repo containing some scripts I use.
Please read all scrips before using them.
I may not be the author of all the scripts here, if thats the case, the original
author is likely listed in the script.

All scripts should pass shellcheck without issues, so portabilty should
not be of any concern.
If the script does not pass shellcheck, I will be modifying it so that it does.
An issue should be present if a script is added, and does not pass shellcheck.


Overview
--------

  - bmks
    - A browser independent bookmark script 
    - Uses dmenu, but should easily be usabe with fzf, rofi, bemenu etc
    - Based off of the bmks script found on Suckless' website
    - Ive since rewritten it with some twists for practise

  - dmpv
    - Play videos in ~/Videos in mpv from dmenu
    - Similarly to bmks, it probably works with fzf, rofi etc aswell.

  - dsearch
    - Search the web with dmenu
    - Only handles searchstrings currently

  - bri
    - Change screen brightness
    - Requires path to brightness file
      - Exists in /sys/class/backlight/*
      - Must have read/write access to said file
        - Permission for this file doesnt persist across reboots, so creating a
          script that sets correct permissions on boot is required.

  - holup
    - A script that just waits.
    - Usefull for launching an xorg-session without a WM, or restart your WM
      etc, without killing the xorg-session.
