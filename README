Scripts
-------

A repo containing some scripts I use.
Please read all scrips before using them.
I may not be the author of all the scripts here, if thats the case, the original
author is likely listed in the script.

All scripts should pass shellcheck without issues, so portabilty should
not be of any concern. If something is non-portable, please let me know.

If the script does not pass shellcheck, I will be modifying it so that it does.
An issue should be present if a script is added, and does not pass shellcheck.


The following scripts require wmutils[0] to work:
  - groups.sh
  - workspace.sh
