Scripts
-------

A repo containing some scripts I use.
Please read all scrips before using them.
I may or may not be the original author all scripts in this repo. 
If Im not the author of said script, original author is probably listed in the 
script, if they chose to include it themselves.

I aim for all of the scripts in this repo to pass shellcheck, and as a secondary
goal, all scripts being posix compliant.
This also counts for scripts not originally written by me. Said scripts is
modified to pass shellcheck.


The following scripts require(/is used with) wmutils[0] to work:
  - groups.sh
  - workspace.sh
  - fullscreen.sh
    - depend on focus.sh
  - focus.sh
