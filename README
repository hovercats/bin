Scripts
-------

A repo containing some scripts I use.


Overview
--------

  - bmks
    - A browser independent bookmark script. 
    - Can use dmenu and fzf, and probably rofi and bemnu etc aswell
    - Originally published on the Suckless website, but it was written in bash,
      so I ran shellcheck on it, and corrected it accordingly. Should now be
      posix.

  - dmpv
    - Play videos in ~/Videos in mpv from dmenu
    - Similarly to bmks, it probably works with fzf, rofi etc aswell.

  - dsearch
    - search the web with dmenu
    - only handles searchstrings currently
