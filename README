Scripts
-------

A repo containing some scripts I use.
Please read all scrips before using them.
I may not be the original author of every script here,but Ive chosen to add them
regardless, as Ive likely made some changes to them to fit my system.
Original author is likely listed if this is the case.

All scripts should pass shellcheck, and be posix. if not, I have probably not
gotten around to it yet. That is, unless its intentional.

The following scripts require(/is used with) wmutils[0]:
  - groups
  - workspace
  - fullscreen
  - focus
  - tile
