Scripts
-------

A repo containing some scripts I use.


Overview
--------

  - bmks
    - A browser independent bookmark script 
    - Uses dmenu, but should easily be usabe with fzf, rofi, bemenu etc
    - Based off of the bmks script found on Suckless' website
    - Ive since rewritten it with some twists for practise

  - dmpv
    - Play videos in ~/Videos in mpv from dmenu
    - Similarly to bmks, it probably works with fzf, rofi etc aswell.

  - dsearch
    - search the web with dmenu
    - only handles searchstrings currently
