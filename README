Scripts
-------

A repo containing some scripts I use.


Overview
--------

  - bmks
    - A browser independent bookmark script 
    - Uses dmenu, but should easily be usabe with fzf, rofi, bemenu etc
    - Based off of the bmks script found on Suckless' website
    - Ive since rewritten it with some twists for practise

  - dmpv
    - Play videos in ~/Videos in mpv from dmenu
    - Similarly to bmks, it probably works with fzf, rofi etc aswell.

  - dsearch
    - Search the web with dmenu
    - Only handles searchstrings currently

  - bri
    - Change screen brightness
    - Requires path to brightness file
      - Exists in /sys/class/backlight
      - Must have read/write access to said file
